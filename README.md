# LabAutomation
Tools that will be used to help automate a lab in an education environment.

There are 3 components:
* setup - initial system setup scripts.
* ScriptRunner - a SSH automation script
* Scripts - A user driven script for quick changes.
* WoL - Wake on Lan scripts for the lab

# Setup
Each station needs an SSH server to be installed and associated configuration scripts set up. Also iptables must allow incoming connections to the SSH server. The setup_system.sh script attempts to do all of this. I recommend coping it to a USB drive and running on each system.

# ScriptRunner
This is a SSH automation script that will automatically login to each IP within a range and execute a script. It can be execute using the following command:
 
 sudo python lab_automation.py
 
Once executed it will leverage the credentials in the password.conf file or PKI certs in your .ssh directory to authenticate. It will then copy over the contents of the "auto_script.sh" and execute it.

# Scripts
This is a very simply scratch space used to rapidly deploy tools. It is meant to be execute by the user using the following command:
 
 sudo curl -L http://bit.ly/ics355_scratchraw | sudo bash
 
 # WoL
 Wake on Lan scripts that send the magic packet to turn on each machine. Just run the shell script and it will do it all.
 
 Requires wakeonlan
 
  sudo apt-get install wakeonlan
